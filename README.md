# CIS 376 VOTE
Semester project for CIS 376: Software Engineering II. VOTE (Virtual Online Tabulation with Ease) is a system that allows users to create ballots, vote, and view results.

Our team will go through the software development life cycle to create a desktop application that interacts with a remote database for easy virtual voting.

# How to Deploy
To run our program, simply run the VOTE.exe file. You do not need to do anything to connect to the database as this is handled in the program.

Other Notes:
- Be sure to check out our GitHub Project in the Projects tab to see how we used the project management concepts discussed in class.
- When viewing our commits, there are are few that needed to be changed after the fact due to the author not showing up properly. These commits are cec9cc6, 86fa3a7, and 65ccfe8. These all appear under December 1, 2020, but they were originally commited earlier. There is a comment on each of them that states the original date. To view the commits in order, use the git log command rather than relying on the GitHub commits page.
