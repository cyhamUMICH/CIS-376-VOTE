# CIS 376 VOTE
Semester project for CIS 376: Software Engineering II. VOTE (Virtual Online Tabulation with Ease) is a system that allows users to create ballots, vote, and view results.

Our team will go through the software development life cycle to create a desktop application that interacts with a remote database for easy virtual voting.

Notes:
- Be sure to check out our GitHub Project in the Projects tab to see how we used the project management concepts discussed in class.
- When viewing our commits, there are are few that needed to be changed after the fact due to the author not showing up properly. These commits are <a href="https://github.com/cyhamUMICH/CIS-376-VOTE/commit/cec9cc6">cec9cc6</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyhamUMICH/CIS-376-VOTE/commit/86fa3a7">86fa3a7</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cyhamUMICH/CIS-376-VOTE/commit/65ccfe8">65ccfe8</a>. These all appear under December 1, 2020, but they were originally commited earlier. There is a comment on each of them that states the original date. To view the commits in order, use the git log command rather than relying on the GitHub commits page.

# How to Deploy
To run our program, download this project as a ZIP folder. Then, unzip the folder and navigate to VOTE > VOTE > bin > Release. Finally, simply run the VOTE.exe file. You do not need to do anything to connect to the database as this is handled in the program.
