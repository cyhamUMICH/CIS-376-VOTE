# CIS-376-VOTE
Semester project for CIS 376: Software Engineering II. VOTE (Virtual Online Tabulation with Ease) is a system that allows users to create ballots, vote, and view results.

Our team will go through the software development life cycle to create a desktop application that interacts with a remote database for easy virtual voting.
